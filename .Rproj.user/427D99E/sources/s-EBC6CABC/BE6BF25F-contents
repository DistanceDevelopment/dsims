Title: Distance Sampling Simulations
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Performs distance sampling simulations.It repeatedly generates
    instances of a user defined population within a given survey region, generates
    realisations of a survey design and simulates the detection process. The 
    data are then analysed so that the results can be compared for accuracy 
    and precision across all replications. This will allow users to select survey 
    designs which will give them the best accuracy and precision given their 
    expectations about population distribution. Any uncertainty in population 
    distribution or population parameters can be included by running the different 
    survey designs for a number of different population descriptions. An example 
    simulation can be found in the help file for make.simulation.
