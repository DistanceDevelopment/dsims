Population Description: discrete continuous individual level covariates can included population Detectablity: detectability population can described either half normal, hazard rate uniform detection shapes. Parameters can vary stratum Detectablity: Covariate parameters can included modify scale parameter individual based covariate values. Analyses:number detection function analyses can incorporated simulation model lowest criterion (AIC / AICc / BIC) selected. Analyses:Defining analyses based arguments passed Distance R library. Simulations: Simulations can run serial parallel progress output. Simulations: function run.survey can used create single instance survey check simulation setup.","code":""}]
